Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning to inventory management. It includes:

Custom Environment: Simulates inventory levels, orders, and holding costs.
Q-Learning Agent: Learns to optimize reorder quantities to minimize costs.
Synthetic Data Generation: Simulates various inventory scenarios for training and testing.
Installation
To get started, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas

Usage
Generate Synthetic Data

First, generate synthetic data to simulate different inventory scenarios. This data will include inventory levels, orders, demand, costs, and rewards.

Define Environment and Agent

Implement the environment and Q-learning agent. The environment models inventory dynamics, while the agent learns the optimal ordering policy.

Train the Agent

Initialize the environment and the Q-learning agent. Train the agent over a specified number of episodes to learn the best reorder quantities.

Test the Agent

Evaluate the agentâ€™s performance by running it in the environment and assessing the total reward. The total reward indicates the effectiveness of the learned policy, with a lower total reward suggesting higher holding costs.

Data Generation
The synthetic data generation function simulates historical data for inventory management. This includes various parameters such as inventory levels, order quantities, demand patterns, costs, and rewards.

Q-Learning Algorithm
The Q-learning algorithm is used to optimize reorder quantities based on the feedback from the environment. It involves:

Environment: Simulates the dynamics of inventory management.
Agent: Learns the optimal policy for ordering inventory to minimize costs.
Results
The total reward obtained after testing reflects the performance of the agent. A more negative total reward indicates higher costs. To improve performance, consider adjusting the hyperparameters or increasing the number of training episodes.
